# Nearby Drivers Endpoint Implementation

## Overview

Created a new endpoint that finds nearby available drivers for a pending order using the LocationPointService.

## New Endpoint

**GET** `/order/{orderId}/nearby-drivers`

### Parameters

- `orderId` (path): The order ID to find drivers for
- `radius` (query, optional): Search radius in kilometers (default: 10)

### Response Structure

```json
{
  "orderId": "ord_12345",
  "orderLocation": {
    "latitude": 30.7865,
    "longitude": 31.0004,
    "address": "123 Shop Street, Tanta, Egypt"
  },
  "searchRadius": 10,
  "totalDriversFound": 5,
  "availableDrivers": 3,
  "drivers": [
    {
      "driverId": "driver123",
      "name": "Ahmed Hassan",
      "phone": "+20123456789",
      "location": {
        "latitude": 30.787,
        "longitude": 31.001,
        "address": "Near Tanta Square"
      },
      "rating": 4.5,
      "status": "available",
      "notificationToken": "fcm_token_here"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Implementation Details

### 1. OrderService Enhancement

- Added `findNearbyDriversForOrder(orderId, radiusKm)` method
- Uses LocationPointService to find drivers within specified radius
- Filters only available drivers (status = 'available')
- Returns comprehensive driver information including location and contact details
- Validates that order exists and is in PENDING status

### 2. OrderController Enhancement

- Added `findNearbyDriversForOrder(req, res, next)` method
- Handles request validation and response formatting
- Supports optional radius parameter

### 3. Route Implementation

- Added GET route `/order/:id/nearby-drivers`
- Includes comprehensive Swagger documentation
- Protected with user authentication middleware

### 4. Postman Collection Update

- Added new endpoint to Order Management section
- Includes query parameters for radius configuration
- Ready for testing with proper authentication

## Key Features

### ✅ **Validation**

- Order must exist
- Order must be in PENDING status
- Order must have valid sender location coordinates

### ✅ **Smart Filtering**

- Only returns available drivers
- Filters by distance radius
- Includes driver metadata (rating, phone, notification token)

### ✅ **Comprehensive Response**

- Order location details
- Search statistics (total vs available drivers)
- Driver contact information for notifications
- Location details for distance calculations

### ✅ **Error Handling**

- Order not found
- Invalid order status
- Missing location coordinates
- Service errors

## Business Logic

1. **Order Validation**: Ensures order exists and is in correct status
2. **Location Extraction**: Uses sender details location as search center
3. **Driver Search**: Leverages LocationPointService for spatial queries
4. **Status Filtering**: Only returns drivers with 'available' status
5. **Data Enrichment**: Includes all necessary driver details for matching

## Usage Examples

### Find Drivers (Default 10km radius)

```
GET /order/ord_12345/nearby-drivers
Authorization: Bearer {token}
```

### Find Drivers (Custom radius)

```
GET /order/ord_12345/nearby-drivers?radius=20
Authorization: Bearer {token}
```

## Integration Points

- **LocationPointService**: For spatial driver queries
- **Order Management**: Integrates with existing order workflow
- **Driver Management**: Uses driver location and status data
- **Notification System**: Provides notification tokens for driver alerts

## Next Steps for Enhancement

1. **Auto-Assignment**: Automatically assign closest available driver
2. **Push Notifications**: Send order notifications to nearby drivers
3. **Distance Calculation**: Add exact distance to each driver
4. **Driver Filtering**: Add filters for rating, vehicle type, etc.
5. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket integration for live driver positions
6. **Machine Learning**: Intelligent driver matching based on historical data

This endpoint provides the foundation for intelligent order-driver matching in your shipping application!
